                    <p><b><i>What's the meaning of life?</i></b> (This is not an essay arguing for a definitive answer; it simply shares non-personal perspectives from different angles.)</p>
                    <p>In the documentary Examined Life, <b><i>Cornel West</i></b> responds to this question:</p>
                    <p><i> "I think the problem of meaning is very important. <b><i>Nihilism</b></i> is a serious challenge. <b><i>Meaninglessness</b></i> is a serious challenge. Even making sense of meaninglessness itself is a kind of discipline and achievement. The problem, of course, is that you never reach it. It's not a static, stationary telos — not an end or final aim. It's a process that one never reaches. It's Sisyphean. You're pushing the rock up the hill looking for better meanings or grander, more ennobling, more enabling meanings, but you never reach it. In that sense you die without having the whole, in the language of romantic discourse." </i></p>
                    <p><b><i>The Myth of Sisyphus (French: Le mythe de Sisyphe)</i></b> is a philosophical essay <b><i>Albert Camus</i></b> published in 1942. In it Camus develops his philosophy of the <b>absurd</b>: the tension between humanity’s basic need to find meaning and the universe’s indifferent, irrational silence. Camus argues that recognizing the absurd cannot justify suicide; rather, it demands resistance.</p>
                    <p>Camus identifies the clash between our "thirst for meaning" and the universe’s "irrational silence" as constitutive of the absurd. He insists this absurdity must be met with clear-eyed confrontation, not with appeals to transcendence.Camus identifies the clash between our "thirst for meaning" and the universe’s "irrational silence" as constitutive of the absurd. He insists this absurdity must be met with clear-eyed confrontation, not with appeals to transcendence.</p>
                    <p>He then sketches several possible responses to an absurd life. In the essay’s final chapter he compares the absurdity of human existence to the fate of Sisyphus from Greek myth. Cursed to roll a boulder up a hill only to watch it tumble back down each time it nears the summit, Sisyphus performs an endless, apparently meaningless task. Camus concludes: "The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."</p> 
                    <p>Camus uses Sisyphus’s eternal, futile labor as an image of modern people trapped in repetitive, pointless work in factories and offices. "The laborer of today spends his life doing the same tasks; that fate is equally absurd. But it is only when this absurdity is recognized that it becomes tragic."</p>
                    <p>Camus writes that the absurdity of life is inevitable — like the daily grind of living, working, going to school, taking exams — and we are not called to deny the absurd but to learn to live with it. Therefore our grasp of meaning is always insufficient; it can never fill the cracks in life. Even if we beg meaning for answers, it offers none. Yet precisely because meaning is permanently lacking, we continue to pursue it.</p>
                    <p>The subject keeps acting because we continually try to make up for that essential lack. At its core is a structural deficiency that can never be filled. In other words, meaning is not something meant to be found once and for all; meaning exists to be sought — to sustain the ongoing process of searching.</p>
