        <div class="post-content">
                    <p><b><i>What's the meaning of life?</b> In a movie called <b>"Soul"</b>, it tells:</p></i>
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <img src="https://img.voguehk.com/media/2021/02/pixar_soul_disney_stream.2e16d0ba.fill-735x490.png" alt="Examined Life documentary poster">
</div>    
          <p> In Soul, there’s a character named <b><i>Dez</b></i>. On the outside, he looks like someone who has it all figured out: a talented barber who clearly enjoys his work. To <b><i>Joe</b>, the protagonist</i>, it seems obvious that Dez has found his <b><i>“spark”</b> — the one thing that gives his life meaning.</i> If you are good at something and you love doing it, then that must be your purpose, right?</p>
          <p>But when <b><i>22</b></i>, temporarily inhabiting Joe’s body, chats with Dez out of curiosity, a different story emerges. Dez reveals that his real dream was never to become a barber. He wanted to be a veterinarian. Unfortunately, his family could not afford the cost of veterinary school, so he chose a barber school instead, simply because it was cheaper. That practical decision ended up shaping the course of his entire life.</p>
          <p>At first, <b><i>Joe and 22</b> assume Dez must be living with regret.</i> But Dez surprises them — and me. He says he is genuinely happy. Barbering wasn’t his dream, and he doesn’t believe he was <b><i>“born”</b></i> to do it, yet interacting with people, making them feel good about themselves, makes his days meaningful. <i>That subtle revelation felt like a wake-up call: meaning might not come from destiny but from how we show up in ordinary moments.</i></p>
          <h2><b><i>Nihilism</i></b></h2>        
      <p>This idea resonates with <b><i>Nietzsche’s concept of nihilism,</b></i> but not the passive kind that simply denies value. Nietzsche described a situation that feels eerily familiar: when the traditional sources of meaning — religion, moral absolutes, social norms — fade, we are left to confront a world without predetermined answers. <i>The challenge is not whether life has meaning in itself, but whether we are willing to live fully and responsibly in a world that offers no guaranteed meaning.</i></p>
      <p> Nietzsche urged what we might call an <b><i>“active nihilism.”</b></i> After acknowledging that the world does not hand us meaning on a platter, we are invited to take responsibility for creating value —<i> not once and for all, but continuously, through how we live.</i></p>
      <p>What Soul suggests — quietly and tenderly — is that life’s worth is not found in some grand calling but in the way we engage with the present. A meal shared, a breeze felt, a genuine conversation — these seemingly ordinary moments are where life begins to shine again. Not because they point to a larger destiny, but because they are lived fully.</p>
      <p>Nietzsche’s thought experiment of <b><i>eternal recurrence</b></i> asks a haunting question: if every moment of your life were to repeat forever, would you choose to live it again, exactly as it is? <i>The film doesn’t give a dramatic or radical answer. Instead, it offers something softer: as long as you are willing to live, to feel, and to connect with the world around you, then even without a “spark” or a grand dream, your life is already worth repeating.</i></p>
          <p><i>Perhaps a “spark” is not a mission waiting to be discovered, but something that is truly ignited only when we decide to live earnestly.</i></p>
          <div class="quote-section">
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The meaning of your life is defined the moment you decide to find a meaning for your life.</p>
